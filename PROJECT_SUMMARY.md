# E-commerce Application - Project Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

I've created a complete full-stack e-commerce web application with three distinct user roles:

### 🎭 Three User Roles

1. **Customer**
   - Register and login
   - Browse products
   - Shopping cart functionality
   - Place orders

2. **Seller**
   - Submit registration REQUEST (not direct registration)
   - Wait for admin approval (status: pending)
   - Login ONLY after admin approves
   - Upload and manage products in dashboard
   - View product inventory

3. **Admin**
   - Secure login (backend registration only)
   - Comprehensive dashboard with tabs:
     - Overview (statistics)
     - Pending Sellers (approve/reject)
     - All Sellers
     - All Products (can delete)
     - All Customers

## 🔄 Seller Registration Workflow (As Requested)

```
1. Seller visits /seller-register
   ↓
2. Fills registration form with business details
   ↓
3. Submits REQUEST to admin (status: PENDING)
   ↓
4. Admin logs into /admin-dashboard
   ↓
5. Admin views "Pending Sellers" tab
   ↓
6. Admin clicks "Approve" or "Reject"
   ↓
7. If APPROVED: Seller status changes to 'approved'
   ↓
8. Seller can NOW login at /seller-login
   ↓
9. Seller uploads products in dashboard
   ↓
10. Products appear on customer products page
```
